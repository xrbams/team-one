This might lead people into workaholism and exhaustion. Good self-leadership skills help to protect people’s well-being both as a student and later in the working life. \r\n\r\nCommunication skills are basic skills that can develop throughout life. The importance of good communication skills in working life is constantly growing. A person with good communication skills is able to recognize and appreciate different personality types and is capable of considering other people’s feelings and opinions as well as negotiating solutions in conflicts. Communication skills are needed not only in face-to-face situations but also in writing. Good communication skills improve working atmosphere, efficiency and well-being of the workers. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this course is to study the basic tools of self-leadership and develop one’s communication skills.",
