They could include e.g. tools for time and stress management as well as exercises to improve awareness of oneâs strengths, needs, values, attitudes, thoughts and feelings. \r\n\r\nThe modern work culture that underlines efficiency and quantity over quality easily steers people towards instant needs satisfaction instead of focusing on the good quality of life. This might lead people into workaholism and exhaustion. Good self-leadership skills help to protect peopleâs well-being both as a student and later in the working life. \r\n\r\nCommunication skills are basic skills that can develop throughout life. The importance of good communication skills in working life is constantly growing. A person with good communication skills is able to recognize and appreciate different personality types and is capable of considering other peopleâs feelings and opinions as well as negotiating solutions in conflicts. Communication skills are needed not only in face-to-face situations but also in writing. Good communication skills improve working atmosphere, efficiency and well-being of the workers. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this course is to study the basic tools of self-leadership and develop oneâs communication skills.",
